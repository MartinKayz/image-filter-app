# Image filter application in Numpy

The Image Filter App is a web application that allows users to upload an image and apply various filters to it. The app is built using Python, NumPy, and the Streamlit web framework.

## Features

1. Image uploading: Users can upload an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG formats) from their local system.
2. Filter selection: Users can choose from different filters to apply to the uploaded image. The available filters are:
    - None: No filter is applied.
    - Grayscale: Converts the image to grayscale.
    - Invert: Inverts the colors of the image.
    - Blur: Applies a blur effect to the image.
3. Visualize original and filtered images: The app displays the original image and the filtered image side by side for comparison.
